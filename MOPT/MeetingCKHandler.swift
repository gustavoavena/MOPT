/*

	The CKHandlers will be responsible for fetching records and returning objects, updating the records after updating the objects, fetching the new/updated records and updating the objects.

	It needs to implement an update() method that will have multiple signatures, one for each record attribute.
	They will all update the modified property and call the method responsible for saving the whole record after the modifications.

	IMPORTANT methods that all CKHandelers must implement:
	func fetchByID(recordID: CKRecordID, handleUserObject: @escaping (CKRecord?, Error?) -> Void)
	func saveRecord(record: CKRecord)

	They will probably all inherit from CloudKitHandler...

	Notes: We need to decide which will by synchronous and which will be asynchronous, to avoid delaying the main thread and UI operations.
	For example, *save* methods can by async, because they will not affect the UI (the object will be locally modified and willbe correctly displayed, while on the background the record is updated remotely).
